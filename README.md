# Deep_Learning_Neural_Networks_Cifar10
Extended Deep Learning Solutions for providing solutions to the Multi-Class Classification Problem of the Cifar-10 Dataset.

Welcome to the **CIFAR-10 Multi-Class Classification** repository! This repository contains an extensive exploration of various Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches to solve the CIFAR-10 image classification problem. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

## Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of different ML and DL techniques applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset. Each approach has its own directory with implementation details, code, and results. The approaches range from traditional machine learning models to advanced deep learning architectures. The goal of this project was understanding the different architectures in depth, while exploring a number of libraries.
